### Description

FPSMatch is a library mod designed to support team-based competitive FPS gameplay within Minecraft. It provides a flexible framework for custom match design and item management, rather than implementing complete game modes itself.

**Core Features**
- Provides foundational systems for team-based matches, including map instances and spectator support
- Economy framework: enables custom money systems and team-specific shops for weapons, gear, and throwables
- Offers utilities for seamless integration with weapon mods (e.g., Tacz) and tactical equipment
- Supports custom bomb defusal and other objective-based scenarios through its API

**Technical Structure**
- Provides admin tools: shop/map editors, command systems, and stat tracking modules
- Designed for extensibility: developers can define custom modes, items, and gameplay logic

**Designed For Customization**
- No built-in game content; serves as a code framework for creating FPS experiences
- Supports custom HUD
- Tracks player stats (KDA, headshots, damage) in custom match formats
